# 学习Github

## 学习总结

### Git
Git is adistributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

### Repositories
Repositories also containREADMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

### Branches
You can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

### Forks
Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects.

### Pull requests
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. 

## 感想

通过这节课我了解和学习了Github的相关知识，学习了如何使用Github，并且克隆课程仓库到自己账号下的仓库，学会了如何将修改后的文件上传到原仓库。
除了Github，我还学习了如何写markdown文件，并且在创建同名仓库后，我写了一个自述文件来介绍自己。
